1. Procurement is generated via procurement process (SEE Procurment documentation)

2. Inventory Receives (Please ensure the products procured has asset model set in the product category)

To generate asset model or run single asset please use this guide.. 

Go to Asset and tracking module--> Assets 
1. Create an asset
2. Enter the original value 
3. Fill in the other required details
Set the Depreciation methods as follows
a. Method as straight line
b. Duration e.g 5 Years / months 
c. Computation : No Prorata 
d. Prorata date 

Note based on the requirement, the computation is done as follows 
if computation is set as No prorata: 
here is our derived formula: 100 / Duration / custom_period if this is set in years otherwise 
percentagevalue = 100 / Duration / custom_period

depreciation value = original_value = percentagevalue / 100

if computation is set as Constant period: 
here is our derived formula: 100 / Duration / custom_period if this is set in years otherwise 
percentagevalue = 100 / Duration / custom_period

depreciation value = original_value = percentagevalue / 100
